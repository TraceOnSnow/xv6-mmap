**Status:** program fully works.

# Online Resources Used

**Resources:**

**ChatGPT**:
- Just in general, used when I was unfamiliar with functions
- Used to help us with some functions in dealing/implement the file-backed
- Used to better understand errors that I might get and not understand the meaning behind

**Github**:
- Used similar repos and sources on github as a guide for how to approach implementation of sections that we had trouble with
- Used to understand xv6-structure, understand different ways to go about implementing system calls

**Stack overflow and geeks for geeks**:
- used to familiarize ourselves more with functions or ideas that we weren't familiar with using
